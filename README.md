# Mon Projet Sass

This project uses the 7-1 architecture pattern and is organized as follows:

- `sass/abstracts/`: Contains Sass utilities, helpers, variables and functions.
- `sass/base/`: Contains the boilerplate code for the project, such as reset and typography rules.
- `sass/components/`: Contains CSS code for each component, such as buttons.
- `sass/layout/`: Contains CSS code for the layout of the project.
- `sass/pages/`: Contains page-specific styling.
- `sass/themes/`: Contains code related to the theme of the website.
- `sass/vendors/`: Contains third-party CSS code, such as Bootstrap.
- `sass/main.scss`: The main Sass file that imports all other Sass files.
- `css/style.css`: The compiled CSS file that is included in the HTML.

## How to use

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run sass` to compile your Sass to CSS.
